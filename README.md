# Online Collaboration Guidelines

The following guidelines are intended to help organise files and to make online collaboration easier.

It is strongly tailored towards working with Ableton Live as this is the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that the founding members of the collective use to compose music.

If you don't have Ableton Live installed you can [sign up for a free 90 day trial](https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/).

Use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `D` (Windows) or `⌘` + `D` (Macintosh) to bookmark this page for future reference.

## Introduction

Ableton Live is a music production application and comes in three different editions (Intro, Standard and Suite).

The different editions can be compared [here](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/compare-editions/).

In order to open each other's Ableton Live project files collaborators need to be using the same edition of Live.

If all collaborators aren't using the same edition of Live, use the guidelines shown in this [help article](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209769925) to create a Live Set that is accessible from all versions.

## Ableton Live Default Template

We have created an Ableton Live project template with online collaboration in mind.

Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/thekeypals/ableton-live-project-template).

This template is intended to be user friendly and all audio and MIDI tracks have been grouped into the following colour coded categories.

| Colour    | Category    |
| :---------| :-----------|
| Red       | Percussion  |
| Orange    | Bass        |
| Green     | Guitars     |
| Yellow    | Keys        |
| Blue      | Vocals      |
| Purple    | Effects     |
| Grey      | Other       |
| White     | Misc        |

The 'Other' group is for instruments that don't fall into the first six categories, whilst the 'Misc' group should be used for tracks such as reference tracks that don't feature in the final song.

The idea behind using the same template and colour scheme consistently is that musicians will be able to work together faster, better and more efficiently.

## Ableton Live User Library

The User Library is where all of your own presets, defaults, clips, default Live Sets and more are stored.

The User Library is separate from the Core Library content so that it can be easily backed up or shared between different Live installations or computers.

Download the latest version of our Ableton Live User Library [here](https://github.com/thekeypals/ableton-live-user-library).

## File Management

The easiest way to share projects with each other online is via a shared cloud storage platform such as Google Drive or Dropbox, although this method is also the most likely to cause errors in performance and file-indexing.

For more details on the potential risks (and how to avoid them), read [this article](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002855960) on the Ableton website.

We've found it best to work on projects locally (on our own computers) before compressing the **entire Project folder** and sharing with each other via the cloud.

Note that before sharing an Ableton Live project with a collaborator you must first use the [Collect All and Save](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209775645) function to collate all the referenced files. This creates a copy of all samples used, and some other things, so that any user who opens your project should get it just as you created it.

The only thing that Ableton is unable to copy across are 3rd party plugins (VSTs). The only way to ensure that the person gets your full project, if you have used 3rd party plugins, is to resample any midi into audio files and to then select collect all and save.

Don't forget to create backups of your work! Ideally you want to have your work in at least two different places at all times, ideally three.

## Naming Conventions

When collaborating online it's important to name new versions of a song in a consistent and logical manner so that everybody involved knows which file is the latest version.

The collective labels work in progress files sequentially as 0.1, 0.2 etc. The mastered version is then labelled 1.0.

Below is a example of how The Beatles' shared Google Drive might have looked if they'd had access to the internet in 1966.

### Work in Progress Files

| File Name | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| 19660526_YellowSubmarine_McCartneyJP_v0.1 | Paul McCartney creates a new project and records bass |
| 19660527_YellowSubmarine_LennonJW_v0.2    | John Lennon adds acoustic guitar |
| 19660529_YellowSubmarine_StarkeyR_v0.3    | Ringo Starr adds vocals and drums |
| 19660530_YellowSubmarine_HarrisonG_v0.4   | George Harrison adds backing vocals and tambourine |
| 19660601_YellowSubmarine_MartinGH_v1.0    | George Martin logs into Ableton and exports the master track |

### Mixed Masters

| File Name                       | Explanation                 |
| :-------------------------------| :---------------------------|
| YellowSubmarine_MASTER_Full     | Master song                 |
| YellowSubmarine_MASTER_InstOnly | Instrumental only           |

### Mixed Stems

*Grouped tracks with processing.*

| File Name                       |
| :-------------------------------|
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Bass       |
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Effects    |
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Guitars    |
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Keys       |
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Other      |
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Percussion |
| YellowSubmarine_STEM_Vocals     |

### Unmixed Tracks

*Individual tracks without processing. It’s always best practice to export your individual tracks as 'dry' as possible - meaning you should only include effects that are crucial to the sound of the instrument, but nothing more.*
